## A cryptocurrencies market data Dashboard

# Project Ambitions

This project aims to create an interactive dashboard for real-time analysis and visualization of cryptocurrencies prices. The first  main ambitions of the project are as follows:

1. **Web Scraping**: Extract real-time data (Bitcoin prices) from **CoinMarketCap** using a **Bash** script. This allows collecting relevant information for trading strategies based on time series data.
2. **Interactive Dashboard**: Build a dynamic dashboard with **Dash (Python)** to visualize the collected data. The dashboard will display a time series graph of prices, as well as basic financial analysis like **volatility** and **moving averages**.


*Further details on the features and architecture of the project will be added later.*
